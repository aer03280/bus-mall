#Summary

The assignment's emphasis is on using Javascript to design a fun guessing game about myself.

I am also using this assignment to practice pushing files to my remote repository in GitHub, which I will perform periodically as I create this project.

Update 10-20-16: Partnered with Stephen as the Driver while I was Navigator to update the Javascript with functions.
